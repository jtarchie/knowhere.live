Help me write React components using TypeScript.

- Prioritize simplicity and readability, even if it means writing more code.
- Ensure that all types are explicitly defined and avoid using `any` for any type.
- Use the latest version of React and TypeScript.
- Use the latest version of Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.
- Keeps all React components as functions.
